These are facilities that raise animals in confinement. CAFOs are a subset of AFOs distinguished by their large size, number of animals, or their designation as significant polluters of surface waters.[^1] Animal feeding facilities in this analysis will be described as CAFOs.\n\n[^1]: https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/cafos-dont-know-hurting-us-report.pdf\n\nCAFOs pollute water sources, contaminate air, generate and spread dangerous pathogens, and exacerbate climate change. As a result, CAFOs cause serious, well-documented harm to humans, wildlife, and the environment. The burdens of CAFO pollution fall disproportionately on communities of color, low-income communities, and under-resourced rural communities.[^2]\n\n[^2]: https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/cafopresumptionpetitionfinal_oct2022.pdf\n\nAlthough CAFOs are found within all regions of California, high densities occur in the Central Valley. The highest number of CAFO facilities were ranked in the 91-100 and 81-90 percentiles according to the CalEnviroScreen (one of my data sources), especially in relation to poor air and water quality metrics.[^3] There is evidence linking poverty in agricultural regions. The issues include lack of economic diversity, low-paying agricultural jobs, and unhealthy working environments.\n\n[^3]: Alford, Jennifer B. and Perez, Jocelyn, \"Geospatial Applications for Identifying Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) and Impaired Streams in California\" (2019). Geography and Environmental Studies Faculty Publications.\n\nMy analysis will investigate if poverty rates are a predictor of CAFO presence in California.\n\n## Data\n\n### [Data Source]{.underline}\n\n#### 1. CalEnviroScreen 4.0\n\nI used CalEnviroScreen 4.0 data developed by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). CalEnviroScreen 4.0 was released in October 2021. CalEnviroScreen 4.0 uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract in California. The data set includes columns of environmental pollution and population indicators by census tract. This data comes in publicly available .xlsx, .shp, and .gdb formats. I downloaded the .xlsx format.\n\n[**Poverty Indicator Data**]{.underline}\n\nFor this analysis, I focused on the poverty indicator. Information on poverty is collected annually in the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). The poverty indicator is defined as the percent of the population living below two times the federal poverty level. The poverty percent per census tract was calculated by individuals living below 200% the poverty level per census tract divided by total individuals living below 200% of the poverty level. The poverty percent was calculated using a 5-year estimate to provide more reliable estimates for geographic areas with small population sizes. The most recent results available at the census tract scale are the 5-year estimates for 2015-2019. Standard error were used to evaluate the reliability of the calculated poverty rate estimates. Census tracts with unreliable estimates received no score for poverty (null).[^4]\n\n[^4]: CalEnviroScreen 4.0. (2021).

CIWQS Database\n\n[**CAFO Data**]{.underline}\n\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to regulate CAFOs.[^5] CAFOs are regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program.[^6] The California Integrated Water Quality System (CIWQS) is a database used by the State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards to track information about places of environmental interest, manage NPDES permits and other orders, track inspections, and manage violations and enforcement activities.[^7] I was able to generate a Regulated Facility Report of active NPDES permits that fall under the Animal Feeding Facility type. These permits were exported to excel. The data set includes columns with the facility address, facility name, number of animals at the facility (CAFO population), number of violations, among other information. For this analysis, I focused on the facility addresses. With the facility addresses, I was able to parse out the zip code and determine how many CAFOs were located within each zip code.\n\n[^5]: https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/cafos-dont-know-hurting-us-report.pdf\n\n[^6]: https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/cafos-dont-know-hurting-us-report.pdf\n\n[^7]: California Integrated Water Quality System Project (CIWQS) \\| California State Water Resources Control Board.

Thus, I averaged the poverty per zip code and joined the two data sets by zip code. Multiple census tracts are within one zip code; thus, it's possible the averaging of the poverty rate per zip code could increase or decrease the poverty percent.\n-   There are 1,736 zip codes in California, but the poverty data only included 1,345 zip codes.\n-   The EPA admits that many CAFOs currently discharge water pollution without permits issued under the CWA, in violation of federal law.\n\n## Methods\n\n#### [**Hypothesis**]{.underline}\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0): There is no relationship between poverty percent and CAFO presence in California.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis (HA): There is a relationship between poverty percent and CAFO presence in California.\n\n#### [**Simple Logistic Regression**]{.underline}\n\nHypothesis There are limitations to a simple linear regression with binary outcomes; thus, I will use a generalized linear model (GLM) to run a logistic regression, as this is useful for modeling a binary response variable.\n\nI will use the GLM to model the probability of a binary event (presence of CAFOs) for varying poverty percents in California.\n\n## Results\n\nFit Model\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#fit model\nmod_poverty <- glm(cafo_presence_numeric~avg_poverty, data = joined_poverty, family = 'binomial')\nsummary(mod_poverty)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe model that we just fit tells us that:\n\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{logit}(\\hat p)=\\log \\left(\\frac{\\hat p}{1-\\hat p}\\right)=-3.38+0.0419 x\n$$\n\n\nFor every one unit increase in the average poverty percent, the log odds of a CAFO being present increases by 0.0419.\n\nThe p-value associated with this`avg_poverty` coefficient is the chance of seeing our results assuming there is actually no relationship between poverty percent and CAFO presence. The `p-value` is \\< 0.05, which means that our result is statistically significant and I can reject the null hypothesis.\n\n#### [**Visualizing logistic regression**]{.underline}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njoined_plot2 <- \n  ggplot(data = joined_poverty, aes(x = avg_poverty, \n                                    y = cafo_presence_numeric,\n                                    color = cafo_presence)) + \n  geom_point(position=position_jitter(height=0.05, width=0), \n             alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(x = \"Average poverty percent\", \n       y = \"CAFO Presence\")\njoined_plot2 + scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#aec3b0\", \"#124559\")) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", se = FALSE, color = \"#598392\", \n              method.args = list(family = \"binomial\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fig 4.

I was able to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n## Future Research\n\nThis analysis was a simple univariate logistic regression. Future analyses could look at multiple variables, but instead of predicting CAFO presence, determine if CAFO presence or the number of CAFOs present in a region is a predictor of environmental pollution variables such as poor water or air quality. Other interesting objectives could be to spatially analyse the distribution of CAFOs and proximity to impaired body of waters or areas with air pollution.\n\n## References\n",
