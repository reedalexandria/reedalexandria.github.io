## About Me

::: blue-bg
::: lightgreen-bg
I hold a **Master of Environmental Data Science** from UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. My interests encompass ***Forestry Management, Environmental Policy, Biodiversity Conservation, Sustainable Food Systems, Communication**,* and ***Data Visualization.***

Previously, I completed my ***Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies*** at UCSB, engaging in impactful projects focusing on ***reforestation*** and ***sustainable agriculture*** in South America for a nonprofit organization.

Following my academic journey, I transitioned into the role of an ***Environmental Specialist*** for a consulting company. Here, I **a**ssessed environmental impacts, proposed solutions for clients across various sectors, and observed disparities in environmental effects on marginalized communities, emphasizing the ***necessity of reproducible data science*** in addressing these issues.

My ***goal*** remains leveraging data science to tackle environmental challenges and effectively communicating insights to drive positive change.

## Travels

## National Parks

One of my ultimate life goals is to explore the United States' national parks. With a passion for exploration, I have already embarked on this journey, stepping foot into some of the most iconic national parks across the US. From the rugged landscape of Volcanoes in Hawaii to the awe-inspiring beauty of Glacier in Montana, each park has left a lasting memory.

To keep track of my progress, I've mapped out my national park adventures. This interactive map not only showcases the parks I have had the privilege of exploring but also highlights the ones still awaiting my arrival.

# Read data
np <- read_excel(here("data", "national_parks.xlsx"))

# Function to determine marker color based on the "Visited" status
colorizeVisited <- function(visited) {
  if (visited == "Yes") {
    return("#679c6c")
  } else {
    return("#F26419")
  }
}

# Create popup content function
popup_content <- function(park_name, state, visited, photo) {
  if (!is.na(photo) && !grepl("^NA$", photo, ignore.case = TRUE)) {
    img_tag <- tags$img(src = photo, style = "max-width: 100%; max-height: 200px;")
    paste0("<b>National Park:</b> ", park_name, ", ", state, "<br>",
           "<b>Visited:</b> ", visited, "<br>", img_tag)
  } else {

## Hobbies

During my free time, I enjoy being outdoors and participating in various activities such as playing soccer or volleyball, running, hiking, and camping with friends. Cooking and experimenting with plant-based recipes is another hobby I enjoy. My hobbies help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and bring joy to my everyday routine.
