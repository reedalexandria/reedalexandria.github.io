    "text": "About MeTravel\n\n\nIâ€™m a graduate student in the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. My current interests lie in sustainable food systems, addressing climate change, and reducing carbon footprints. I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Santa Barbara in 2017, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies. As an undergraduate student, I led reforestation and sustainable agriculture projects in South America for a nonprofit organization. After graduating, I worked as an Environmental Specialist for an Environmental, Health, Safety, and Sustainability consulting company, where I evaluated and identified environmental impacts as well as recommended and implemented solutions for clients in the private and public sectors. During my time working as an environmental consultant, I observed the disproportionate environmental impacts in marginalized communities and the need for reproducible data science and visualization skills to develop solutions to environmental issues. My goal is to utilize data science tools to derive data-driven solutions for complex environmental problems and effectively communicate the information so that it is accessible and enacts change.\n\n\nI have had the privilege to travel the World, whether it be for vacation, volunteer opportunities, or work. My goal is to travel to every continent one day! Check out some of the places I have traveled to so far."

    "text": "Conclusion and Limitations\nBased on this analysis, there were approximately 157,411 homes within blackout areas in Houston. Out of the 1,112 census tracts within Houston, 754 census tracks were within the blackout areas. The maps and plots show that census tracts/homes with higher median incomes were impacted by the blackout. This could be due to the fact that homes near city centers tend to be more expensive and people with higher incomes would be living in these homes. One limitation with this study is that when creating the 200-meter buffer surrounding highways, the actual number of homes impacted by the blackout may be miscalculated.\nThe goal of this investigation was to become more familiar with spatial data. The results and findings of this investigation are not final and should not be cited without additional investigations."
