    "text": "Conclusion and Limitations\nBased on this analysis, there were approximately 157,411 homes within blackout areas in Houston. Out of the 1,112 census tracts within Houston, 754 census tracks were within the blackout areas. The maps and plots show that census tracts/homes with higher median incomes were impacted by the blackout. This could be due to the fact that homes near city centers tend to be more expensive and people with higher incomes would be living in these homes. One limitation with this study is that when creating the 200-meter buffer surrounding highways, the actual number of homes impacted by the blackout may be miscalculated.\nThe goal of this investigation was to become more familiar with spatial data. The results and findings of this investigation are not final and should not be cited without additional investigations."

    "text": "Why should you be concerned about CAFOs?\n“Where data were available [regarding CAFOs], both the quantity and nature of the data were highly variable from state to state. States are responsible for collecting information and reporting it to the EPA, but there is no standardized collection or reporting requirement. […] Regulators and the public need this information to protect communities from CAFO pollution and hold the agriculture industry accountable for its impacts under the law.” - Natural Resources Defense Council\n\nEnvironmental Impact and Inadequate Regulations\n\nWater\nUnder the Clean Water Act (Act), CAFOs are defined as point source dischargers. CAFOs are regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program, which prohibits discharges from a CAFO to waters of the U.S. without an NPDES permit. However, more than 20,000 CAFOs across the U.S. are unregulated under the Act, resulting in poor regulatory oversight regarding pollution discharge.3\n\n\n\nThe EPA’s 2000 National Water Quality Inventory found that 29 states identified AFOs as contributing to water quality impairment. The agriculture sector, is the leading contributor of pollutants to lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. The EPA has found that states with high concentrations of CAFOs experience on average 20 to 30 serious water quality problems per year.4\n\n\nAir\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), require reporting of releases of hazardous substances. The purpose of these reports is for officials to evaluate the need for an emergency response to mitigate the effects of a release to a community. However, the EPA exempts the reporting of air emissions from animal waste at farms.5\nAccording to the CDC, CAFOs contribute to over 7% of Greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Manure from CAFOs emit methane and nitrous oxide which are 23 and 300 times more potent that carbon dioxide. However, a lack of air emission data makes it difficult to accurately quantify the exact air quality impacts and greenhouse gas emissions associated with CAFOs.\n\n\n\nWater and air quality are just two of the myriad of environmental health effects caused by CAFOs, others include: odor, insect vectors, pathogens, and antibiotics."

These negative impacts disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color because of where CAFOs operate and who they employ.”6\n\nEnvironmental Injustice and Missing Data\nSeveral studies indicate that CAFOs are located disproportionately in communities with higher percentage of minorities and in low-income communities.7,8,9 These are areas with other social vulnerabilities, including areas with more residents with disabilities, older residents, and lower socioeconomic status.\nCAFOs pollute the air, water, and soil, harming the quality of life of nearby residents and producing inequitable health effects.10 There are reports of workers and communities surrounding CAFOs with increased health concerns such as asthma, bronchitis, burning eyes, nausea, skin disorders, pain in the throat, and coughing. These symptoms are associated with exposure to chemicals like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and particulate matter, which are found in high concentrations at CAFOs.11\n\n\n\nIn addition, the construction of a CAFO lowers the home and land values surrounding it. A 2015 publication found that properties located within three miles of a CAFO lose up to 26% of their value and neighborhoods within a quarter mile, lose up to 88%.12 Thus, making it more difficult for individuals to sell their property and escape unhealthy living conditions.\nAs discussed, there are numerous studies that associate health effects caused by CAFOs and the proximity to communities of color and high poverty rates. Yet, there is a lack of data to accurately assess these issues due to inadequate and unjust regulations."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe animal agriculture industry comprises hundreds of thousands of individual animal feeding operations (AFOs). These are facilities that raise animals in confinement. CAFOs are a subset of AFOs distinguished by their large size, number of animals, or their designation as significant polluters of surface waters.1 Animal feeding facilities in this analysis will be described as CAFOs.\nCAFOs pollute water sources, contaminate air, generate and spread dangerous pathogens, and exacerbate climate change. As a result, CAFOs cause serious, well-documented harm to humans, wildlife, and the environment. The burdens of CAFO pollution fall disproportionately on communities of color, low-income communities, and under-resourced rural communities.2\nAlthough CAFOs are found within all regions of California, high densities occur in the Central Valley. The highest number of CAFO facilities were ranked in the 91-100 and 81-90 percentiles according to the CalEnviroScreen (one of my data sources), especially in relation to poor air and water quality metrics.3 There is evidence linking poverty in agricultural regions due to lack of economic diversity, low-paying agricultural jobs, and unhealthy working environments.\nMy analysis will investigate if poverty rates are a predictor of CAFO presence in California."

    "text": "Data\n\nData Source\n\n1. CalEnviroScreen 4.0\nI used CalEnviroScreen 4.0 data developed by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). CalEnviroScreen 4.0 was released in October 2021. CalEnviroScreen 4.0 uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract in California. The data set includes columns of environmental pollution and population indicators by census tract. This data comes in publicly available .xlsx, .shp, and .gdb formats. I downloaded the .xlsx format.\nPoverty Indicator Data\nFor this analysis, I focused on the poverty indicator. Information on poverty is collected annually in the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). The poverty indicator is defined as the percent of the population living below two times the federal poverty level. The poverty percent per census tract was calculated by individuals living below 200% the poverty level per census tract divided by total individuals living below 200% of the poverty level. The poverty percent was calculated using a 5-year estimate to provide more reliable estimates for geographic areas with small population sizes. The most recent results available at the census tract scale are the 5-year estimates for 2015-2019. Standard error was used to evaluate the reliability of the calculated poverty rate estimates. Census tracts with unreliable estimates received no score for poverty (NA).4\n\n\n\n\n\n2. CIWQS Database\nCAFO Data\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to regulate CAFOs.5 CAFOs are regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program. The California Integrated Water Quality System (CIWQS) is a database used by the State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards to track information about places of environmental interest, manage NPDES permits and other orders, track inspections, and manage violations and enforcement activities.6 I was able to generate a Regulated Facility Report of active NPDES permits that fall under the Animal Feeding Facility type. These permits were exported to excel. The data set includes columns with the facility address, facility name, number of animals at the facility (CAFO population), number of violations, among other information. For this analysis, I utilized the facility addresses to determine how many CAFOs were located within each zip code.\n\n\n\n\n\nshow the code\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(sf)\n#creating the figure in the column \ncafo_df2<- read_xlsx(here(\"/Users/alexreed/Documents/MEDS/Courses/EDS_222/final_project/EDS222_Final/data/Regulated_Facility_Report_Detail.xlsx\")) |>\n  clean_names()\n\ncafos_plot <- cafo_df2 |>\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\ncafos_plot |>\nleaflet() |>\naddProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldTopoMap, group = \"World Imagery\") |>\naddProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite, group = \"Toner Lite\") |>\naddLayersControl(baseGroups = c(\"Esri.WorldTopoMap\", \"Toner Lite\")) |>\n  addCircles()\n\n\n\n\n\nData Download and Basic Visualizations\n\n\nshow the code\n#load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\n\n#read in CalEnviro data and subset poverty data\ncal_enviro <- read_xlsx(here(\"/Users/alexreed/Documents/MEDS/Courses/EDS_222/final_project/EDS222_Final/data/calenviroscreen40resultsdatadictionary_F_2021.xlsx\")) |>\n  clean_names()\n\ncal_enviro$zip <- as.character(cal_enviro$zip)\n\n#poverty subset\ncal_enviro_poverty <- cal_enviro |>\n  select(\"california_county\", \"zip\", \"poverty\") |>\n  group_by(zip) |>\n  summarise(avg_poverty = mean(poverty, na.rm = T)) |>\n  drop_na(avg_poverty)\ncal_enviro_poverty$zip <- as.character(cal_enviro_poverty$zip)\n\n\n\n\nshow the code\n#poverty histogram\npoverty_hist <- ggplot(cal_enviro_poverty, aes(x = avg_poverty)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"light gray\") +\n  labs(x = \"Average poverty percent\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Distribution of average poverty percent per zip code\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 12))\npoverty_hist\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1.

Visualizing a binary response\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Limitations\n\nI was unable to locate CAFO location data per census tract. Therefore, I averaged the poverty data per zip code and joined the two data sets by zip code. Multiple census tracts are within one zip code; thus, the averaging of the poverty rate per zip code could increase or decrease the poverty percent of an area.\nThere are 1,736 zip codes in California, but the poverty data only included 1,345 zip codes.\nOut of 8,035 observations, 75 observations had no poverty data (NA). I removed the NAs.\nThe EPA admits that numerous CAFOs currently discharge water pollution without NPDES permits.7 Thus, there may be CAFOs unaccounted for in this analyses."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between poverty percent and the presence of CAFOs in California. As the average poverty percent increases, the probability of CAFO presence increases. As previously mentioned, CAFOs are point sources of pollution. Therefore, my analysis provides evidence that CAFO pollution is disproportionately affecting people with high poverty rates in California, which raises environmental justice issues."

    "text": "Future Research\nThis analysis was a simple univariate logistic regression. Future analyses could look at multiple variables, but instead of predicting CAFO presence, determine if CAFO presence or the number of CAFOs present in a region is a predictor of environmental pollution variables such as poor water or air quality. Other interesting objectives could be to spatially analyze the distribution of CAFOs and proximity to impaired body of waters or areas with air pollution. The end goal would be to provide evidence to inform policy for stricter CAFO regulations and protections for vulnerable communities."
