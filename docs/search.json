    "text": "Conclusion and Limitations\nBased on this analysis, there were approximately 157,411 homes within blackout areas in Houston. Out of the 1,112 census tracts within Houston, 754 census tracks were within the blackout areas. The maps and plots show that census tracts/homes with higher median incomes were impacted by the blackout. This could be due to the fact that homes near city centers tend to be more expensive and people with higher incomes would be living in these homes. One limitation with this study is that when creating the 200-meter buffer surrounding highways, the actual number of homes impacted by the blackout may be miscalculated.\nThe goal of this investigation was to become more familiar with spatial data. The results and findings of this investigation are not final and should not be cited without additional investigations."

    "text": "About MeTravel\n\n\nI’m a graduate student in the Master of Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. My current interests lie in sustainable food systems, addressing climate change, and reducing carbon footprints. I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Santa Barbara in 2017, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies. As an undergraduate student, I led reforestation and sustainable agriculture projects in South America for a nonprofit organization. After graduating, I worked as an Environmental Specialist for an Environmental, Health, Safety, and Sustainability consulting company, where I evaluated and identified environmental impacts as well as recommended and implemented solutions for clients in the private and public sectors. During my time working as an environmental consultant, I observed the disproportionate environmental impacts in marginalized communities and the need for reproducible data science and visualization skills to develop solutions to environmental issues. My goal is to utilize data science tools to derive data-driven solutions for complex environmental problems and effectively communicate the information so that it is accessible and enacts change.\n\n\nI have had the privilege to travel the World, whether it be for vacation, volunteer opportunities, or work. My goal is to travel to every continent one day! Check out some of the places I have traveled to so far."

CalEnviroScreen 4.0 was released in October 2021. CalEnviroScreen 4.0 uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract in California. The data set includes columns of environmental pollution burden indicators by census tract. This data comes in publicly available .xlsx, .shp, and .gdb formats. I downloaded the .xlsx format.\n\nPoverty indicator data\nFor this analysis, I focused on the poverty indicator. Information on poverty is collected annually in the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). The poverty indicator is defined as the percent of the population living below two times the federal poverty level. The poverty percent per census tract was calculated by individuals living below 200% the poverty level per census tract divided by total individuals living below 200% of the poverty level. The poverty percent was calculated using a 5-year estimate to provide more reliable estimates for geographic areas with small population sizes. The most recent results available at the census tract scale are the 5-year estimates for 2015-2019. Standard error were used to evaluate the reliability of the calculated poverty rate estimates. Census tracts with unreliable estimates received no score for poverty (null)."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe animal agriculture industry comprises hundreds of thousands of individual animal feeding operations (AFOs). These are facilities that raise animals in confinement. CAFOs are a subset of AFOs distinguished by their large size, number of animals, or their designation as significant polluters of surface waters.1 Animal feeding facilities in this analysis will be described as CAFOs.\nCAFOs pollute water sources, contaminate air, generate and spread dangerous pathogens, and exacerbate climate change. As a result, CAFOs cause serious, well-documented harm to humans, wildlife, and the environment. The burdens of CAFO pollution fall disproportionately on communities of color, low-income communities, and under-resourced rural communities.2\nAlthough CAFOs are found within all regions of California, high densities occur in the Central Valley. The highest number of CAFO facilities were ranked in the 91-100 and 81-90 percentiles according to the CalEnviroScreen (one of my data sources), especially in relation to poor air and water quality metrics.3 There is evidence linking poverty in agricultural regions. The issues include lack of economic diversity, low-paying agricultural jobs, and unhealthy working environments.\nMy analysis will investigate if poverty rates are a predictor of CAFO presence in California."

Make a binary variable.\njoined_poverty <- left_join(cal_enviro_poverty, cafo_df, by = \"zip\") \njoined_poverty[\"count\"][is.na(joined_poverty[\"count\"])] <- 0 #NA = zip codes without CAFOs, converting to 0 instead of NA\njoined_poverty <- mutate(joined_poverty, cafo_presence = ifelse(count==0, \"not present\", \"present\")) |>\n  mutate(joined_poverty, cafo_presence_numeric = ifelse(cafo_presence==\"not present\", 0, 1))\n#creating two new rows: cafo_presence = 'present' or 'not present', and cafo_presence_numeric = 1 or 0\n\n\nI joined the poverty and CAFO data sets and created a column based on CAFO presence (cafo_presence). If there was a 0 in the count column the cafo_presence column received a not present variable and if there were one or more CAFOs it received a present variable. I created an additional column, cafo_presence_numeric for the numeric equivalence.\nVisualizing a binary response\n\n\nshow the code\njoined_plot <- \n  ggplot(data = joined_poverty, aes(x = avg_poverty, \n                                        y = cafo_presence, \n                                        color = cafo_presence)) +\n  geom_point(position=position_jitter(height=0.05, width=0), \n                 alpha = 0.8) +\n      labs(x = \"Average poverty percent\", \n           y = \"CAFO Presence\")\njoined_plot + scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#aec3b0\", \"#124559\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nshow the code\n#ggsave(\"fig3.png\", width = 8, height = 5, units = \"in\", dpi = 300)\n\n#fig.cap = 'Air quality significantly associate'\n\n\n\n\nData Limitations\n\nI was unable to locate CAFO location data per census tract. Thus, I averaged the poverty per zip code and joined the two data sets by zip code. Multiple census tracts are within one zip code; thus, it’s possible the averaging of the poverty rate per zip code could increase or decrease the poverty percent.\nThere are 1,736 zip codes in California, but the poverty data only included 1,345 zip codes.\nThe EPA admits that many CAFOs currently discharge water pollution without permits issued under the CWA, in violation of federal law."

    "text": "Why should you be concerned about CAFOs?\n“Where data were available [regarding CAFOs], both the quantity and nature of the data were highly variable from state to state. States are responsible for collecting information and reporting it to the EPA, but there is no standardized collection or reporting requirement. […] Regulators and the public need this information to protect communities from CAFO pollution and hold the agriculture industry accountable for its impacts under the law.” - Natural Resources Defense Council\n\nEnvironmental Impact and Inadequate Regulations\n\nWater\nUnder the Clean Water Act (Act), CAFOs are defined as point source dischargers. CAFOs are regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program, which prohibits discharges from a CAFO to waters of the U.S. without an NPDES permit. However, more than 20,000 CAFOs across the U.S. are unregulated under the Act, resulting in poor regulatory oversight regarding pollution discharge.3\n\n\n\nThe EPA’s 2000 National Water Quality Inventory found that 29 states identified AFOs as contributing to water quality impairment. The agriculture sector, is the leading contributor of pollutants to lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. The EPA has found that states with high concentrations of CAFOs experience on average 20 to 30 serious water quality problems per year.4\n\n\nAir\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), require reporting of releases of hazardous substances. The purpose of these reports is for officials to evaluate the need for an emergency response to mitigate the effects of a release to a community. However, the EPA exempts the reporting of air emissions from animal waste at farms.5\nAccording to the CDC, CAFOs contribute to over 7% of Greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Manure from CAFOs emit methane and nitrous oxide which are 23 and 300 times more potent that carbon dioxide. However, a lack of air emission data makes it difficult to accurately quantify the exact air quality impacts and greenhouse gas emissions associated with CAFOs.\n\n\n\nWater and air quality are just two of the myriad of environmental health effects caused by CAFOs, others include: odor, insect vectors, pathogens, and antibiotics."

    "text": "Who is being affected by CAFOs?\n“CAFOs threaten our rural economies, public health, and environmental quality. These negative impacts disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color because of where CAFOs operate and who they employ.”6\n\nEnvironmental Injustice and Missing Data\nSeveral studies indicate that CAFOs are located disproportionately in communities with higher percentage of minorities and in low-income communities.7,8,9 These are areas with other social vulnerabilities, including areas with more residents with disabilities, older residents, and lower socioeconomic status.\nCAFOs pollute the air, water, and soil, harming the quality of life of nearby residents and producing inequitable health effects.10 There are reports of workers and communities surrounding CAFOs with increased health concerns such as asthma, bronchitis, burning eyes, nausea, skin disorders, pain in the throat, and coughing. These symptoms are associated with exposure to chemicals like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and particulate matter, which are found in high concentrations at CAFOs.11\n\n\n\nIn addition, the construction of a CAFO lowers the home and land values surrounding it. A 2015 publication found that properties located within three miles of a CAFO lose up to 26% of their value and neighborhoods within a quarter mile, lose up to 88%.12 Thus, making it more difficult for individuals to sell their property and escape unhealthy living conditions.\nAs discussed, there are numerous studies that associate health effects caused by CAFOs and the proximity to communities of color and high poverty rates. Yet, there is a lack of data to accurately assess these issues due to inadequate and unjust regulations."
